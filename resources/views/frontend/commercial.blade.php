    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <div><h1> Site Assessment and Designing</h1>
                <p>Our workflow starts with a face-to-face consultation with the client, followed by a site assessment to determine whether your property is suitable for solar panel installation. Then, our team provides you with a detailed CAD drawing of your system. Our expert designer creates a design with your location and weather conditions in mind. The design is then approved by the client before the actual installation process begins.</p></div>      
                   <div> <h1>System Installation</h1>
                      <p>Every installation, regardless of the system size, big or small, is carried out by our certified and professional installers. Our solar system installation occurs in four separate stages:<br>

           1. Fasten structure to the roof<br>
           2. Secure panels to the structure<br>
           3. Complete external wiring to connect panels to the inverter<br>
           4. Wire the inverter to the home’s power supply</p><br></div>
